```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### PROBLEM

Write two functions. These functions should take a numeric vector as an input, and determine the mean and median from the values in the vector.


```{r}
myMean <- function (x) {
  sum <- sum(x)
  len <- length(x)
  avg <- sum/len
  print(avg)
}

myMedian <- function(x) {
  sorted <- sort(x)
  len <- length(sorted)
  print(sorted[len/2])
}

myMedian(c(12,12,12,12,12,15,455))

myMean(c(12,12,12,12,12,15,455))

```
